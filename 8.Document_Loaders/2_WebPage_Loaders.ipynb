    "### LangChain documentation on **loading and processing web pages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Overview**\n",
    "- **Web Pages**: Contain text, images, and multimedia, typically represented in HTML.  \n",
    "- **Challenges**: Extracting content can be complex due to varying structures, dynamic content, and the need to handle HTML/JavaScript.  \n",
    "- **LangChain Loaders**: Provide tools to fetch and process web content efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Supported Loaders**\n",
    "LangChain supports multiple web page loaders, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. WebBaseLoader**\n",
    "- **Description**: A general-purpose loader for fetching content from web pages.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Extracting text content from static or dynamic web pages.  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n",
    "  loader = WebBaseLoader(web_paths=[\"https://example.com\"])\n",
    "  documents = loader.load()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. SeleniumLoader**\n",
    "- **Description**: A loader that uses Selenium to fetch content from dynamic web pages (e.g., pages with JavaScript).  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Extracting content from web pages that require rendering or interaction.  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_community.document_loaders import SeleniumLoader\n",
    "  loader = SeleniumLoader(urls=[\"https://example.com\"])\n",
    "  documents = loader.load()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. PlaywrightLoader**\n",
    "- **Description**: A loader that uses Playwright to fetch content from dynamic web pages.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Similar to SeleniumLoader but with better performance and modern browser automation features.  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_community.document_loaders import PlaywrightLoader\n",
    "  loader = PlaywrightLoader(urls=[\"https://example.com\"])\n",
    "  documents = loader.load()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. RSSLoader**\n",
    "- **Description**: A loader for fetching content from RSS feeds.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Extracting structured content (e.g., news articles, blog posts) from RSS feeds.  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_community.document_loaders import RSSLoader\n",
    "  loader = RSSLoader(feed_url=\"https://example.com/feed\")\n",
    "  documents = loader.load()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Choosing the Right Loader**\n",
    "- **Static Web Pages**: Use `WebBaseLoader`.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Web Pages**: Use `SeleniumLoader` or `PlaywrightLoader`.  \n",
    "- **RSS Feeds**: Use `RSSLoader`.  \n",
    "- **Custom Needs**: LangChain allows you to create custom loaders for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Additional Features**\n",
    "- **Metadata Extraction**: Most loaders extract metadata (e.g., URL, title) along with the content.  \n",
    "- **Lazy Loading**: Some loaders support lazy loading (`lazy_load()`), which is useful for processing large amounts of content incrementally.  \n",
    "- **Customization**: Loaders can be customized to handle specific web page structures or extract specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Example Workflow**\n",
    "Here’s an example of using `WebBaseLoader` to fetch content from multiple URLs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "urls = [\"https://example.com/page1\", \"https://example.com/page2\"]\n",
    "loader = WebBaseLoader(urls)\n",
    "documents = loader.load()\n",
    "\n",
    "for doc in documents:\n",
    "    print(f\"URL: {doc.metadata['source']}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content[:200]}...\")  # Print first 200 characters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Advanced Parsing**\n",
    "- **Tool**: `UnstructuredLoader`.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Extracts multiple `Document` objects per page, representing sections, lists, tables, etc.  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_unstructured import UnstructuredLoader\n",
    "  loader = UnstructuredLoader(web_url=\"https://example.com\")\n",
    "  docs = loader.load()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Granular Control**: Each `Document` object includes metadata (e.g., category, parent-child relationships) for advanced processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Extracting Specific Sections**\n",
    "- **Method**: Use metadata (e.g., `category`, `parent_id`) to isolate specific sections (e.g., \"Setup\").  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  async def _get_setup_docs_from_url(url):\n",
    "      loader = UnstructuredLoader(web_url=url)\n",
    "      setup_docs = []\n",
    "      async for doc in loader.alazy_load():\n",
    "          if doc.metadata[\"category\"] == \"Title\" and doc.page_content.startswith(\"Setup\"):\n",
    "              setup_docs.append(doc)\n",
    "      return setup_docs\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Vector Search**\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Index web content for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore\n",
    "  from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n",
    "  vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())\n",
    "  retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(\"query\", k=2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- **Multiple Options**: LangChain provides a variety of web loaders to suit different needs.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Content**: Loaders like `SeleniumLoader` and `PlaywrightLoader` can handle dynamic web pages.  \n",
    "- **Structured Data**: Loaders like `RSSLoader` are optimized for structured content.  \n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: All loaders integrate seamlessly into LangChain’s document processing pipeline.  \n",
    "- **Advanced Features**: Use `UnstructuredLoader` for granular control over web content and metadata.  \n",
    "- **Integration**: Loaded documents can be indexed and used in downstream tasks like RAG.\n",

It is a clear indication that there is a good amount of money waiting to come into the market. So, while it is likely the market will stay in stock-specific mode, it would pay to remain bullish.

The stocks on our list today depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars – earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum.
