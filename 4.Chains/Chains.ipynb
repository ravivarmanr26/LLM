    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains refer to sequences of calls—whether to a Language Model (LLM), a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to construct these chains is through the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-the-Shelf Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCEL is excellent for constructing your chains, LangChain also provides off-the-shelf chains. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains supported by LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chains Built with LCEL**: \n",
    "   - LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method for these chains. \n",
    "   - Under the hood, they are constructed using LCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legacy Chains**: \n",
    "   - These chains are constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. \n",
    "   - Unlike LCEL chains, they do not use LCEL under the hood but are standalone classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on creating methods to generate LCEL versions of all chains for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifiability**: Chains constructed with LCEL allow for easy modification of their internals.\n",
    "- **Native Support**: These chains support streaming, asynchronous operations, and batch processing out of the box.\n",
    "- **Observability**: They automatically provide observability at each step of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page contains two lists:\n",
    "- A list of all LCEL chain constructors.\n",
    "- A list of all legacy Chains."

Its multi-touch interface, app store, and sleek design made it an instant hit among consumers. The iPhone's impact on the smartphone industry was significant, and its influence can still be seen today.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The Smartphone Revolution Continues (2010s)**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2010s, smartphones continued to evolve at a rapid pace. Advances in camera technology, augmented reality (AR) capabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled apps made even more intuitive and engaging. This led to a proliferation of smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other connected devices that expanded beyond traditional smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. The Future of Smartphones (2020s)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, smartphones are ubiquitous, with over 4.3 billion mobile phone users worldwide. New technologies like foldable screens, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence are transforming the smartphone experience. As we move forward, we can expect to see even more innovative features, such as augmented reality glasses, implantable chips, and advanced biometric security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the evolution of smartphones has been a remarkable journey, from humble beginnings to the high-tech devices they are today. With continued innovation and advancements in technology, smartphones will continue to shape the way we live, work, and communicate.\n"

      "Hi there, kiddo! I'm Robert, your math teacher. Now, when you're in high school or college, you'll likely encounter the fascinating world of linear algebra. But don't worry, I'm here to break it down for you in a way that's easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra is like a toolkit for solving systems of equations and manipulating vectors. It's an essential part of mathematics, engineering, physics, and computer science. So, let's dive right in!\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are vectors?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're riding a bike on a flat road. You can only control the direction and speed you move, but not your height or weight. A vector is like a package that contains both information about direction (x-axis) and magnitude (length). In linear algebra, we use vectors to represent changes in quantities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Linear Equations**\n",
      "\n",
      "A linear equation is like a recipe: A + B = C, where A, B, and C are numbers or expressions. We can graph these equations on a coordinate plane, which helps us visualize the relationships between variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like a simple example:\n",
      "\n",
      "2x + 3y = 7\n",
      "\n",
      "This equation says that for every two units you move in the x-direction (2), you need to add three units in the y-direction (3) to reach point C with coordinates (5, 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Matrices**\n",
      "\n",
      "A matrix is like a table of numbers that can be used to store information about vectors and their transformations. In linear algebra, we use matrices to represent systems of equations, change of basis, and other important concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let's say we have two vectors: A = (2, 3) and B = (-1, 4). We can create a matrix M with these vectors as rows:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "| 2  -1 |\n",
      "| 3  4 |\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This matrix represents the linear transformation that takes vector A to vector B.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Linear Transformations**\n",
      "\n",
      "A linear transformation is like a math operation that changes the input (vector) in some way, while leaving the output (result) unchanged. Think of it as scaling, rotation, or translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, let's say we have a matrix M and a vector V. We can multiply V by M to get a new vector:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "| 2  -1 |\n",
      "| 3  4 |\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This multiplication operation scales vector V by a factor of 2 along the x-axis and 3 along the y-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solving Systems of Equations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra is all about solving systems of linear equations. We can use matrices, determinants, and other techniques to find the solution (x, y) that satisfies multiple equations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like a game where we have two or more variables (x, y), and we want to find their values that satisfy both equations. Linear algebra provides powerful tools for solving these systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Applications**\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra has many real-world applications, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Computer graphics: Understanding transformations and scaling helps create 3D models and animations.\n",
      "* Engineering: Linear algebra is used in CAD (computer-aided design) software to optimize designs and solve problems.\n",

      "Hello there, young historian! I'm Vignesh, and I'm excited to share some fascinating history with you. Today, we're going to explore one of the most significant events in American history: the discovery of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of America's \"discovery\" is a bit complex, as it's often misunderstood. While it's true that European explorers were among the first people to set foot on what would become the United States, they didn't actually discover a land that was already inhabited by indigenous peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1492, Christopher Columbus, an Italian explorer sponsored by the Spanish monarchs, set sail across the Atlantic Ocean in search of a new route to Asia. He landed on an island called Guanahani in the Bahamas, which he named San Salvador. Over time, other European explorers followed in his footsteps, including Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama.\n",
      "\n",
      "These early explorers didn't stumble upon a blank slate; they actually found islands that had already been inhabited by Native American tribes for thousands of years. In fact, the Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, established a settlement at Vinland (present-day L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada) around 1000 AD, over 500 years before Columbus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indigenous peoples who lived in what would become the United States had been exploring and settling along the eastern coast of North America for centuries. They had their own distinct cultures, languages, and ways of life, which were vastly different from those of the Europeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why did Columbus and other explorers think they could just \"discover\" a new land? The answer lies in European imperialistic ambitions. The idea was that the New World offered vast resources, fertile lands, and untapped potential for expansion and exploitation. The European powers saw themselves as superior to indigenous peoples and believed that their arrival marked the beginning of a new era of civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequences of this \"discovery\" were devastating for many Native American tribes. They were forcibly relocated, their lands were taken over by European colonizers, and their cultures were suppressed or erased. It wasn't until the late 18th century, with the rise of the abolitionist movement and the fight for Native American rights, that the legacy of Columbus Day began to shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we remember Christopher Columbus as a figure who \"discovered\" America, rather than acknowledging the complex history and cultural contributions of indigenous peoples. However, I hope this explanation helps you understand the nuances of this historical event. And who knows? Maybe one day we'll look back on this chapter in American history with a more nuanced perspective.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What are Runnables?**\n",
    "Runnables are components in LangChain that allow you to define and execute sequences of operations or transformations on data. They can be thought of as modular units of work that can be combined to create complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Runnables?**\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Runnables promote code reusability and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain your code.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: They allow you to chain together various operations, including invoking models, processing data, and applying custom logic.\n",
    "- **Composability**: You can easily combine multiple runnables to create more complex workflows without tightly coupling the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RunnableLambda\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is RunnableLambda?**\n",
    "`RunnableLambda` is a type of runnable that allows you to wrap a custom Python function as a runnable. This enables you to integrate custom logic into your LangChain workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use RunnableLambda?**\n",
    "1. **Define a Custom Function**: Create a Python function that performs a specific operation.\n",
    "2. **Wrap the Function**: Use `RunnableLambda` to wrap your function, making it compatible with the LangChain framework.\n",
    "3. **Integrate into a Chain**: Combine `RunnableLambda` with other runnables in a chain to process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Use RunnablePassthrough?**\n",
    "- **Maintain Structure**: It helps in keeping the flow of data intact in a chain, especially when you want to add a placeholder for future modifications.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: It can be used for debugging purposes to inspect data at various stages in a chain without altering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",

Planets are typically defined as objects that:\\n\\n1. Are in orbit around another object (in this case, the Sun).\\n2. Have sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape (i.e., they are nearly round in shape).\\n3. Have cleared their orbital zone of other objects.\\n\\nPlanets can be classified into different types, including:\\n\\n* Terrestrial planets (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus)\\n* Gas giants (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn)\\n* Ice giants (e.g., Uranus, Neptune)\\n\\n**Star:** A star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. Stars are the primary sources of light and heat for our solar system.\\n\\nThe Sun is a specific type of star known as a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). This classification means that the Sun is:\\n\\n* A yellow dwarf star, which is a relatively cool and small star.\\n* In its main sequence stage, where it fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. (This is the longest-lived phase of a star\\'s life.)\\n* The largest star we know of, with a radius about 109 times that of our Earth.\\n\\nStars like the Sun are important for life on Earth because they provide energy and light to support life. They also play a crucial role in shaping the planets\\' atmospheres through their magnetic fields and solar winds.\\n\\n**Why is it called a planet when the star is so massive?**\\n\\nIn 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term \"planet\" to better reflect our understanding of the solar system. According to this definition, a planet must:\\n\\n1. Be in orbit around the Sun.\\n2. Have sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape.\\n3. Have cleared their orbital zone of other objects.\\n\\nThe Sun meets these criteria, but a planet must not meet one or more of the three conditions to be considered a planet. For example, Pluto does not meet the third criterion because its orbit overlaps with that of Neptune and there are other objects in its orbit that are larger than it.\\n\\nSo, while the Sun is massive and luminous, it\\'s still classified as a planet because it meets the first two criteria, but not the third.'}\n"

Here's a breakdown of the main inputs:\\n\\n1. **Orbital Characteristics**: The orbit of Earth around the Sun is elliptical, which means its distance from the Sun varies throughout the year. This variation affects the amount of energy the planet receives.\\n\\n2. **Distance and Energy Received**: The closer Earth comes to the Sun (perihelion), it receives more solar energy due to the increased surface area exposed to direct sunlight. Conversely, when it's farthest away (aphelion), the received solar energy is less, but there are other factors at play that make life on Earth possible.\\n\\n3. **Atmospheric and Atmospheric Loss**: The atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and protecting life from harmful radiation. However, as high-energy particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere, they can strip away atmospheric gases like oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2), which are essential for human respiration.\\n\\n4. **Tidal Forces**: The gravitational pull of the Sun on Earth causes tides to occur on our planet. These tides have significant effects on coastal ecosystems, marine life, and the global ocean currents.\\n\\n5. **Gravitational Interactions with Other Objects in Space**: The Sun is not alone in its orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy; there are other stars and gas clouds nearby. Gravity plays a role in shaping the solar system's structure and influencing the orbits of planets like Earth.\\n\\n6. **Solar Wind and Cosmic Rays**: The Sun emits charged particles, known as the solar wind, which can interact with Earth's magnetic field, potentially affecting satellite technology and human health. Additionally, high-energy cosmic rays can damage living tissues and contribute to the aging process over time.\\n\\n7. **Gravitational Lensing Effects**: According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, massive objects like stars warp spacetime around them. The gravitational lensing effects caused by these massive objects have been detected in various astrophysical observations, affecting our understanding of gravity and its role in shaping the universe on a cosmic scale.\\n\\n8. **Planetary Rotation and Axis Tilting**: Earth's rotation causes it to spin on its axis while orbiting the Sun. This results in different seasons on our planet as we move from one side of the equator towards the poles, and there are variations due to the tilt of the axis itself.\\n\\n9. **Volcanic Activity and Geological Processes**: The presence of volcanic activity and geological processes like earthquakes and plate tectonics are influenced by Earth's interior dynamics, which are governed by principles such as convection currents in the mantle and interactions with external forces.\\n\\n10. **Geological and Climatological Factors**: These include natural climate patterns like El Niño events, ocean circulation, and volcanic eruptions that influence our planet's weather and climate conditions.\"}\n"
