    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains refer to sequences of calls—whether to a Language Model (LLM), a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to construct these chains is through the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-the-Shelf Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCEL is excellent for constructing your chains, LangChain also provides off-the-shelf chains. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains supported by LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chains Built with LCEL**: \n",
    "   - LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method for these chains. \n",
    "   - Under the hood, they are constructed using LCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legacy Chains**: \n",
    "   - These chains are constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. \n",
    "   - Unlike LCEL chains, they do not use LCEL under the hood but are standalone classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on creating methods to generate LCEL versions of all chains for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifiability**: Chains constructed with LCEL allow for easy modification of their internals.\n",
    "- **Native Support**: These chains support streaming, asynchronous operations, and batch processing out of the box.\n",
    "- **Observability**: They automatically provide observability at each step of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page contains two lists:\n",
    "- A list of all LCEL chain constructors.\n",
    "- A list of all legacy Chains."

Its multi-touch interface, app store, and sleek design made it an instant hit among consumers. The iPhone's impact on the smartphone industry was significant, and its influence can still be seen today.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The Smartphone Revolution Continues (2010s)**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2010s, smartphones continued to evolve at a rapid pace. Advances in camera technology, augmented reality (AR) capabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled apps made even more intuitive and engaging. This led to a proliferation of smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other connected devices that expanded beyond traditional smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. The Future of Smartphones (2020s)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, smartphones are ubiquitous, with over 4.3 billion mobile phone users worldwide. New technologies like foldable screens, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence are transforming the smartphone experience. As we move forward, we can expect to see even more innovative features, such as augmented reality glasses, implantable chips, and advanced biometric security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the evolution of smartphones has been a remarkable journey, from humble beginnings to the high-tech devices they are today. With continued innovation and advancements in technology, smartphones will continue to shape the way we live, work, and communicate.\n"

      "Hi there, young mathematician! I'm Robert, your friendly math teacher. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"Linear algebra? That's not what we learn in math class.\" And you're right, it's not the same as algebra like we learned in middle school or earlier high school. But linear algebra is actually a fundamental part of mathematics that can seem weird at first, but it has many cool applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's dive into it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with two main ideas: vectors and matrices. Think of it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're playing basketball with your friends. You have three positions on the court: point guard, shooting guard, and power forward. Each position has its own unique role, but they all work together to create a cohesive team.\n",
      "\n",
      "In linear algebra, we use mathematical objects called vectors to represent these positions. A vector is like an arrow that points from one place to another. For example, if you're the point guard, your vector would be (3, 4), which means you have three \"units\" of movement on the court and four \"units\" in the direction you need to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, imagine we want to find out where each player is on the court after a game. We can use vectors to represent their positions. By combining all the vectors, we get a single vector that shows where everyone is on the court at any given time!\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of linear algebra is about matrices. Think of it like this: a matrix is like a table with rows and columns. Each entry in the table represents a number that tells us something about the positions of objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we have three players (A, B, and C) with their respective position vectors on the court:\n",
      "\n",
      "|  | A | B | C |\n",
      "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
      "| Point Guard | (3, 4) | (5, 6) | (7, 8) |\n",
      "| Shooting Guard | (1, 2) | (3, 4) | (5, 6) |\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use matrices to find the total position of all players on the court at any given time. It's like combining all the individual vectors to get a single vector that represents the entire team.\n",
      "\n",
      "One cool application of linear algebra is in computer graphics and game development. You might have heard of games like Fortnite or Minecraft, where you need to move your character around on a 2D or 3D plane. In these games, we use matrices to represent the positions of objects (like players or items) and update their positions based on user input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another application is in scientific computing and data analysis. We often work with large datasets and want to perform calculations like finding the best fit line for a set of points. Linear algebra helps us do that by representing these calculations as matrices, which allows us to easily solve problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you see, linear algebra might seem weird at first, but it's actually a powerful tool that can help us analyze and understand complex systems in many areas of science and engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does this explanation make sense? Do you have any questions about vectors or matrices?\n"

      "\n",
      "Pirapokkum and uyirkum are words in Tamil, which is the language used in many parts of India, particularly in the southern states. \"Ellam\" means \"book\" or \"text,\" and \"thirukural\" refers to a classic Tamil text on poetry and literature called the Thirukural.\n",

      "Hello there, young historian! I'm Vignesh, and I'm excited to share some fascinating history with you. Today, we're going to explore one of the most significant events in American history: the discovery of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of America's \"discovery\" is a bit complex, as it's often misunderstood. While it's true that European explorers were among the first people to set foot on what would become the United States, they didn't actually discover a land that was already inhabited by indigenous peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1492, Christopher Columbus, an Italian explorer sponsored by the Spanish monarchs, set sail across the Atlantic Ocean in search of a new route to Asia. He landed on an island called Guanahani in the Bahamas, which he named San Salvador. Over time, other European explorers followed in his footsteps, including Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama.\n",
      "\n",
      "These early explorers didn't stumble upon a blank slate; they actually found islands that had already been inhabited by Native American tribes for thousands of years. In fact, the Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, established a settlement at Vinland (present-day L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada) around 1000 AD, over 500 years before Columbus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indigenous peoples who lived in what would become the United States had been exploring and settling along the eastern coast of North America for centuries. They had their own distinct cultures, languages, and ways of life, which were vastly different from those of the Europeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why did Columbus and other explorers think they could just \"discover\" a new land? The answer lies in European imperialistic ambitions. The idea was that the New World offered vast resources, fertile lands, and untapped potential for expansion and exploitation. The European powers saw themselves as superior to indigenous peoples and believed that their arrival marked the beginning of a new era of civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequences of this \"discovery\" were devastating for many Native American tribes. They were forcibly relocated, their lands were taken over by European colonizers, and their cultures were suppressed or erased. It wasn't until the late 18th century, with the rise of the abolitionist movement and the fight for Native American rights, that the legacy of Columbus Day began to shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we remember Christopher Columbus as a figure who \"discovered\" America, rather than acknowledging the complex history and cultural contributions of indigenous peoples. However, I hope this explanation helps you understand the nuances of this historical event. And who knows? Maybe one day we'll look back on this chapter in American history with a more nuanced perspective.\n",
