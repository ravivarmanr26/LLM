    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains refer to sequences of calls—whether to a Language Model (LLM), a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to construct these chains is through the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-the-Shelf Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCEL is excellent for constructing your chains, LangChain also provides off-the-shelf chains. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains supported by LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chains Built with LCEL**: \n",
    "   - LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method for these chains. \n",
    "   - Under the hood, they are constructed using LCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legacy Chains**: \n",
    "   - These chains are constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. \n",
    "   - Unlike LCEL chains, they do not use LCEL under the hood but are standalone classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on creating methods to generate LCEL versions of all chains for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifiability**: Chains constructed with LCEL allow for easy modification of their internals.\n",
    "- **Native Support**: These chains support streaming, asynchronous operations, and batch processing out of the box.\n",
    "- **Observability**: They automatically provide observability at each step of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page contains two lists:\n",
    "- A list of all LCEL chain constructors.\n",
    "- A list of all legacy Chains."

Apple's iPhone, released in 2007, marked a significant turning point for smartphones, introducing multi-touch interfaces and a user-friendly interface that would become synonymous with the brand.\\n\\n**2. The Rise of Android: 2010-2016**\\n\\nIn 2010, Google launched the Android operating system, which quickly gained popularity among device manufacturers. Over time, Samsung, HTC, and other companies developed their own Android-based devices, offering a range of choices for consumers. This competition drove innovation and pushed the boundaries of what was possible in smartphone technology.\\n\\n**3. The Smartphone Era Continues: 2016-Present**\\n\\nToday, smartphones are more powerful than ever, with advancements in processors, RAM, and storage. They also feature improved cameras, larger screens, and sleek designs that cater to diverse user preferences. Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Bixby have become an integral part of our daily interactions.\\n\\n**4. The Impact on Society: 2010-Present**\\n\\nSmartphones have revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with each other. They enable social media sharing, online banking, and mobile commerce. However, they also raise concerns about privacy, addiction, and the spread of misinformation. As smartphones become more ubiquitous, it's essential to address these issues and ensure that their benefits are equitably distributed.\\n\\n**5. The Future of Smartphones: 2023 and Beyond**\\n\\nAs technology continues to advance, we can expect even more impressive features from smartphones, such as augmented reality capabilities, artificial intelligence-driven assistants, and advanced biometric security measures. The rise of foldable screens, 5G networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT) promises to further transform the smartphone ecosystem in the years to come.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the smartphone has come a long way since its inception, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with each other.

      "I can provide you with information on Dolo-650, but please note that I'll be presenting this as a general overview and not reviewing or endorsing the product. Here's an article about Dolo-650 in 5 points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. What is Dolo-650?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolo-650 is a brand of anti-diarrheal medication containing bismuth subsalicylate, an active ingredient commonly known as Pepto-Bismol. It is used to treat and prevent diarrhea caused by various factors such as food poisoning, viral gastroenteritis, or other gastrointestinal infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Mechanism of Action**\n",
      "\n",
      "Bismuth subsalicylate works by creating an osmotic effect in the gut, drawing water into the intestines and increasing the fluid volume. This helps to soften and move stool through the digestive system, reducing the frequency and severity of diarrhea. Additionally, bismuth subsalicylate has antimicrobial properties that can help to kill bacteria and other microorganisms that may be present in the gut.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Benefits**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolo-650 is effective in treating and preventing diarrhea caused by:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Food poisoning (e.g., salmonella, E. coli)\n",
      "* Viral gastroenteritis (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus)\n",
      "* Other gastrointestinal infections\n",
      "* Diarrhea caused by medications or toxins\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also effective in relieving symptoms such as abdominal cramps, fever, and nausea.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Side Effects and Precautions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Common side effects of Dolo-650 include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., nausea, vomiting)\n",
      "* Stomach cramps\n",
      "* Diarrhea (although usually not persistent)\n",
      "\n",
      "Precautions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders or bleeding disorders should use Dolo-650 with caution.\n",
      "* Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking Dolo-650.\n",
      "* Children under 6 years old should not take Dolo-650 due to the risk of bismuth toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Interactions and Contraindications**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolo-650 may interact with other medications, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Antibiotics\n",
      "* Antacids\n",
      "* Motility agents\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* Patients with severe gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.\n",
      "* Those taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.\n",

      "**Overview of the Program**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Python implementation of a singly linked list, which is a data structure that consists of nodes, each representing a value. In this case, we have three types of nodes: `Node`, `LinkedList`, and `append`, `prepend`, `delete` methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Creating Linked List Objects**: We create an instance of the `LinkedList` class to represent our linked list.\n",
      "2.  **Appending Elements**: The `append` method allows us to add new elements to the end of the linked list. It creates a new node with the given data and appends it to the current head of the list.\n",
      "3.  **Prepending Elements**: The `prepend` method enables us to add new elements to the beginning of the linked list. It simply assigns the new node's value to the `next` attribute of the current head, which is now pointing to our new node.\n",
      "4.  **Deleting Elements**: The `delete` method removes the first occurrence of a node with a specific value from the linked list. If the target value is found, it updates the `head` attribute of the linked list by replacing the original head node with its next node (which contains the deleted element).\n",
      "5.  **Displaying Linked List**: The `display` method prints all values in the linked list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Linked Lists**: A data structure where elements are stored as separate objects, each containing a reference (or \"link\") to the next element.\n",
      "*   **Nodes**: Individual elements in the linked list, which have a value and a reference (\"next\") pointer to the next node.\n",
      "*   **Head**: The first node in the linked list, which serves as an entry point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How the Program Works**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  When we create a new `LinkedList` object, it initializes an empty head node.\n",
      "2.  We then call the `append` method to add two initial elements (1 and 2) to our linked list, followed by prepending another element (3).\n",
      "3.  After this, we print out the values in the linked list using the `display` method, which outputs `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
      "4.  We then delete the value \"2\" from our linked list by calling the `delete` method.\n",
      "5.  Finally, we print again to verify that the deleted element has been successfully removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Walkthrough**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step example of how this program works:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   We create an empty linked list: `LinkedList()`\n",
      "*   We append two elements (1 and 2) to our linked list using `append(1)` and `append(2)`.\n",
      "*   The output shows `[1, 2, 3]`, which confirms that the initial values have been added correctly.\n",
      "*   We prepend another element (3): `prepend(3)`\n",
      "*   After this operation, the new value 3 is appended to our linked list: `[3, 1, 2]`.\n",
      "*   Finally, we delete the value \"2\" from our linked list using `delete(2)`. This operation updates the head node by replacing it with its next node (which contains only the value \"1\").\n",
      "*   After deletion, our linked list is now: `[3, 1]`, which matches the expected output.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this explanation helps you understand how this program works! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarification.\n"

      "Hey there, kiddo! I'm Robert, your math teacher. Now, let's dive into one of my favorite topics in math: linear algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra is like being an architect, but instead of designing buildings, you're working with vectors and matrices to solve problems that involve multiple variables. It's a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of linear relationships between variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a bunch of points on a 2D or 3D plane, and you want to find the best way to move from one point to another while keeping track of how much distance you've traveled and which direction we're moving. That's basically what linear algebra is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several key concepts in linear algebra that I'd like to cover with you:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Vectors**: A vector is a quantity with both magnitude (length) and direction. Think of it like a stick with an arrow on the end, pointing in a specific direction.\n",
      "2. **Matrices**: A matrix is a table filled with numbers and symbols that can be used to represent relationships between variables. You can think of it like a spreadsheet, but instead of rows and columns, you have rows and columns made up of vectors or matrices.\n",
      "3. **Linear transformations**: These are operations that change one vector or matrix into another while preserving the direction. Think of it like rotating a stick around its axis so that it's pointing in a new direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me give you an example to make this more concrete:\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we have two points on a 2D plane: (2,3) and (-1,4). We want to find the best way to move from point A to point B while keeping track of how much distance we've traveled. We can represent these points as vectors:\n",
      "Point A: [2, 3]\n",
      "Point B: [-1, 4]\n",
      "\n",
      "To find the best path, we can use a matrix that represents the linear transformation (or rotation) needed to move from A to B. This matrix will be like a special tool that helps us calculate the distance and direction of our journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we have this matrix, we can multiply it by each vector to get the corresponding displacement vectors, which will give us a set of directions for how far each point on the path has moved. By summing up these displacements, we'll be able to find out the total distance traveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear algebra is all about solving problems like this using matrices and linear transformations. It's an incredibly powerful tool that can help you solve all sorts of real-world problems in fields like engineering, physics, computer science, and even music!\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this explanation helped you understand linear algebra a little better. Do you have any questions or would you like more examples?\n"

      "So, you know how we measure things like distance and speed, right? Like the distance from our house to school is 2 miles. Well, in the past, people used different ways to measure those distances, but they were all kind of rough. That's where math comes in - it helps us figure out exactly how far or fast something is.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me tell you a story about how America was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 1492, and Christopher Columbus had just set sail from Spain with a small fleet of ships. He was on a mission to find a new route to Asia, but he got lost in the Atlantic Ocean. It took him three months to reach North America, which he called \"La Española\" (The Spanish Island).\n",
      "\n",
      "Columbus and his crew explored some parts of North America, including present-day Florida, the Caribbean, and possibly even South America. They found new lands, met with native tribes, and even discovered some amazing plants and animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you might be wondering how long it took Columbus to reach these new lands. Well, let's use some math to figure that out. Let's say Columbus and his crew sailed for 90 days straight, covering a distance of... (wait for it)... 1,100 miles!\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the average speed, we can divide the total distance by the number of days. That means they traveled at an average speed of about 12.5 miles per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's where math gets really cool. If Columbus had to sail through storms and rough seas for some time, it would take him many more days or even weeks to reach these new lands. Let's say he lost one day due to bad weather. That means they actually traveled for 91 days instead of 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find out how long it took them to arrive at La Española, we can subtract the lost day from the original time. So, they arrived in about 9 weeks! That's a pretty rough estimate, but it gives you an idea of just how long it took Columbus and his crew to reach these new lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, math played a huge role in helping us understand what happened when Christopher Columbus set sail for America all those years ago. It helped us calculate distances, speeds, and even estimated the amount of time it would take them to arrive at their destination. Who knew math could be so exciting?\n"
