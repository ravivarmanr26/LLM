    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains refer to sequences of callsâ€”whether to a Language Model (LLM), a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to construct these chains is through the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-the-Shelf Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCEL is excellent for constructing your chains, LangChain also provides off-the-shelf chains. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains supported by LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chains Built with LCEL**: \n",
    "   - LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method for these chains. \n",
    "   - Under the hood, they are constructed using LCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legacy Chains**: \n",
    "   - These chains are constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. \n",
    "   - Unlike LCEL chains, they do not use LCEL under the hood but are standalone classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on creating methods to generate LCEL versions of all chains for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifiability**: Chains constructed with LCEL allow for easy modification of their internals.\n",
    "- **Native Support**: These chains support streaming, asynchronous operations, and batch processing out of the box.\n",
    "- **Observability**: They automatically provide observability at each step of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page contains two lists:\n",
    "- A list of all LCEL chain constructors.\n",
    "- A list of all legacy Chains."

It's a highly adaptable crop that can thrive in diverse environments, including tropical and subtropical regions. The cultivation of paddy requires minimal water, making it an ideal option for areas with limited resources. Additionally, paddy is a natural carbon sink, absorbing more CO2 than many other crops during its growth phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Economic Significance: Rice is a Multi-Billion Dollar Industry**\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice is the second most traded commodity in the world, accounting for over 20% of global food exports. The global rice market is worth billions of dollars annually, with major producers like China, India, and Thailand driving the industry's growth. In some countries, paddy is not only a source of income but also an essential crop for food security, particularly in rural areas where irrigation systems provide a reliable water source.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Social Impact: Paddy Provides Nutrition and Livelihoods**\n",
      "\n",
      "Paddy is more than just a crop; it's a lifeline for millions of people around the world. It provides a primary source of nutrition, especially in areas with limited access to other food sources. Rice is rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and various micronutrients, making it an essential part of many traditional diets. Furthermore, paddy farming often involves labor-intensive work, employing people from rural communities as farmers, herders, or workers on irrigation systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Climate Change Adaptation: Paddy Resists Weather Extremes**\n",
      "\n",
      "Paddy is well-suited to extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts. The crop's ability to absorb water and its rapid growth make it an excellent option for areas prone to water scarcity. In the face of climate change, paddy farming can help mitigate the impacts of rising temperatures, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and changing precipitation patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Cultural Significance: Paddy is a Symbol of Culture and Tradition**\n",
      "\n",
      "Paddy has been an integral part of human culture for centuries, with various traditions and ceremonies tied to its harvesting and consumption. In many Asian countries, paddy is celebrated during harvest festivals, where people come together to share in the bounty of their labor. The cultural significance of paddy extends beyond food production; it also reflects the values of hard work, community, and sustainability that are deeply ingrained in rural cultures worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, paddy is a vital crop that offers numerous benefits for both the environment and human societies. As the global demand for food continues to rise, the importance of sustainable agriculture practices like paddy farming will only continue to grow. By embracing innovative agricultural techniques, promoting climate-resilient crops, and supporting community-led development initiatives, we can ensure that paddy remains a key component of our food systems for generations to come.\n"

      "Dolo-650 (dextromethorphan) is a cough suppressant and expectorant medication that belongs to the phenylpropoxylmethane class of cough medicines. It works by blocking the action of a neurotransmitter called dopamine in the brain, which is involved in regulating coughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Uses**\n",
      "Dolo-650 is primarily used to treat coughs, especially those caused by upper respiratory infections such as the common cold and flu. It's often combined with other medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for enhanced relief from cough symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanism of Action**\n",
      "The cough-suppressing effects of Dolo-650 are thought to be related to its ability to slow down the production of mucus in the lungs, as well as reduce inflammation and irritation in the airways. This makes it a popular choice among both children and adults looking to alleviate cough symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Side Effects and Precautions**\n",
      "Common side effects of Dolo-650 include dry mouth, dizziness, headache, and stomach upset. More serious side effects may include respiratory depression, particularly when combined with other medications or used in large doses. Children under the age of 6 should not use this medication without consulting a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Interactions and Contraindications**\n",
      "Dolo-650 can interact with certain medications, such as sedatives, muscle relaxants, and anticholinergics, which may enhance its effects or increase the risk of side effects. Additionally, Dolo-650 should not be used in people with conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other respiratory problems without consulting a doctor.\n",

      "Smartphones have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. These portable devices have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering a vast array of features that make them an indispensable tool for millions of people around the world. Here are five key facts about smartphones:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Evolution of Mobile Technology**\n",

      "\n",
      "Smartphones have had a profound impact on society, transforming the way we access information, communicate with each other, and conduct our daily lives. They have also created new opportunities for entrepreneurship, job creation, and economic growth. According to a report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), smartphones have enabled billions of people worldwide to access basic services like healthcare, education, and financial services.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Rise of the Smartphone Market**\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone market has grown exponentially over the years, with global sales reaching over 1.5 billion units in 2020.
