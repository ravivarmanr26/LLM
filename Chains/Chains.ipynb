    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains refer to sequences of callsâ€”whether to a Language Model (LLM), a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to construct these chains is through the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-the-Shelf Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "While LCEL is excellent for constructing your chains, LangChain also provides off-the-shelf chains. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains supported by LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chains Built with LCEL**: \n",
    "   - LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method for these chains. \n",
    "   - Under the hood, they are constructed using LCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legacy Chains**: \n",
    "   - These chains are constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. \n",
    "   - Unlike LCEL chains, they do not use LCEL under the hood but are standalone classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on creating methods to generate LCEL versions of all chains for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifiability**: Chains constructed with LCEL allow for easy modification of their internals.\n",
    "- **Native Support**: These chains support streaming, asynchronous operations, and batch processing out of the box.\n",
    "- **Observability**: They automatically provide observability at each step of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page contains two lists:\n",
    "- A list of all LCEL chain constructors.\n",
    "- A list of all legacy Chains."

      "I can provide you with an overview of Dolo-650, but please note that I'll be providing a general summary and not a comprehensive medical review. If you're looking for detailed information, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional or a reliable medical source.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dolo-650: A Breakthrough in Post-Surgical Pain Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolo-650 is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) developed by Bayer Pharma pharmaceutical company, approved by the US FDA in 2020. It's primarily marketed for the short-term management of pain associated with minor to moderate surgical procedures, such as orthopedic and urological surgeries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are five key points about Dolo-650:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mechanism of Action**: Dolo-650 works by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is involved in the production of prostaglandins that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By blocking COX-2, Dolo-650 reduces these symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clinical Trials**: The FDA approved Dolo-650 for use in adults for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain following minor to moderate surgical procedures. Clinical trials demonstrated its efficacy in reducing pain and improving function compared to standard NSAIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Dosage and Administration**: The recommended dosage of Dolo-650 is 650 mg every 4 hours as needed, not to exceed 4 times daily. It can be administered orally or intravenously. Patients should follow the specific instructions provided by their healthcare provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Benefits**: Studies suggest that Dolo-650 may offer benefits beyond standard pain management, including reduced risk of opioid-related complications and improved patient satisfaction. Additionally, its potential to reduce inflammation and enhance recovery may make it a valuable addition to postoperative care.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Side Effects and Interactions**: Common side effects of Dolo-650 include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and liver enzyme elevation. Patients should inform their healthcare provider about all medications they're taking, as Dolo-650 may interact with other substances that could lead to adverse effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on using Dolo-650 or any medication. While Dolo-650 shows promise in managing postoperative pain, it's crucial to weigh the benefits against potential risks and consider alternative treatments depending on individual circumstances.\n"

      "**Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "This program implements a singly linked list, which is a type of data structure where each element (or node) points to the next element. The `LinkedList` class represents the entire list, and its methods (`insert_at_head`, `insert_at_tail`, `delete`, and `print_list`) allow you to add or remove elements from the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Node Class**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Node` class is the core of this program. It represents a single node in the linked list:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Each node has an `__init__` method that takes `data` as an argument, which is the value stored in the node.\n",
      "*   The `next` attribute points to the next node in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Linked List Class**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `LinkedList` class represents the entire list. It has several methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. `insert_at_head(data)`\n",
      "\n",
      "This method inserts a new node with the given data at the head of the linked list. Here's what happens when you call it:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   A new `Node` object is created with the given data.\n",
      "*   If the linked list is empty (`self.head` is None), the new node becomes the head of the list.\n",
      "*   Otherwise, the new node's `next` attribute points to the current head of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. `insert_at_tail(data)`\n",
      "\n",
      "This method inserts a new node with the given data at the tail (or end) of the linked list. Here's what happens when you call it:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   A new `Node` object is created with the given data.\n",
      "*   If the linked list is empty (`self.head` is None), this method does nothing and returns immediately.\n",
      "*   Otherwise, the new node's `next` attribute points to the current tail of the list. The existing tail node becomes the new head.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. `delete(data)`\n",
      "\n",
      "This method deletes the first occurrence of the given data in the linked list. Here's what happens when you call it:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   If the data is found at the head of the list, this method updates the head to point to the next node.\n",
      "*   Otherwise, it searches for the first occurrence of the data in the rest of the list using a while loop.\n",
      "*   Once the data is found, its `next` attribute is updated to skip over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. `print_list()`\n",
      "\n",
      "This method prints the elements of the linked list:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   It starts at the head and traverses the entire list, printing each node's data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Usage**\n",
      "\n",
      "The example code creates a `LinkedList`, inserts some nodes with values 5, 10, and 15 using the `insert_at_head`, `insert_at_tail`, and `delete` methods respectively. Finally, it prints the linked list and deletes one of its elements.\n",
